# Computational-Method-by-using-fortran
This repository help you in understanding and handwaving experience in the basics of numerical and simulation method that help you in wide range of field method 
## Prerequisit for learning :
we are expected to have basic background of fortran-90 language or basics of any other language that will help you in understanding fortran language. we try to make it simple and each and every step is selp explenatory. our main focus will be the numerical methods to solve real life problem.
## outline of content will be given as follows 
#### A.Root finding method 
#### B.Integration method 
#### C.Differentiation method 
#### D.Least Squre Fitting Method
#### E.Interpolation
#### F.Introduction to Monte carlo and there application.

## 1.0 Introduction to Root finding method 
#### Overview : 
During our accademic life we come across various function and we have to find out Root of such function to get clear idea of how function      
behave in some region of space.Sometime its is possible to get root of function analytically but it is not happens allways since some function         
have complicated in nature and unable to handle analytically.In such case we should look toward the better and easy way of handling such problem        
one of such method is Bisection method. We will try to find out Root of function by using bisection method and discuss various difficulty              
come acrross in doing so and other efficient method.
Basically in the ROOT FINDING METHOD  we will learn Following method 
##### Bisection Method 
##### False Position Method 
##### Newton Raphson Method 
##### Secent Method 
We will try to undrstand which method will is better in term of time saving and effient.
In this chapter we will discuss trial and error or iterative method of of finding solution of the equation **f(x) = 0**. these solution are known as the root of the equation **f(x) = 0**.
There are the basic question on coluld ask which are relavant to all the ittrative method. these are the following 
###### 1. Where does one start the ittrative cycle ? In the Other word ,how does one chooses the initial guess value of the root ? 
###### 2. How does one proceed from the initial guess to the subsequent approximations ?
###### 3. How fast do these successive approximation converge to the root ? 
###### 4. How much computational effort is required in each itteration ?
###### 5. When does one stop the iterative cycle ?
we will first consider a method called the bisection method which is a very simple and reliable iterative method.
**The best way to make an initial guess of a root of f(x) = 0 is to sketch x vs f(x). The root of the equation are the points where the graph of y=f(x) cut the x axis.**
