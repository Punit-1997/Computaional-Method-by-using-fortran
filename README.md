# Computational-Method-by-using-fortran
This repository help you in understanding and handwaving experience in the basics of numerical and simulation method that help you in vide range of field method 
## Prerequisit for learning :
we are expected to have basic background of fortran-90 language or basics of any other language that will help you in understanding fortran language. we try to make it simple and each and every step is selp explenatory. our main focus will be the numerical methods to solve real life problem.
## outline of content will be given as follows 
#### A.Root finding method 
#### B.Integration method 
#### C.Differentiation method 
#### D.Least Squre Fitting Method
#### E.Interpolation
#### F.Introduction to Monte carlo and there application.

## Introduction to Root finding method 
#### Overview : 
During our accademic life we come across various function and we have to find out Root of such function to get clear idea of how function      
behave in some region of space.Sometime its is possible to get root of function analytically but it is not happens allways since some function         
have complicated in nature and unable to handle analytically.In such case we should look toward the better and easy way of handling such problem        
one of such method is Bisection method. We will try to find out Root of function by using bisection method and discuss various difficulty              
come acrross in doing so and other efficient method.
Basically in the ROOT FINDING METHOD  we will learn Following method 
##### Bisection Method 
##### False Position Method 
##### Newton Raphson Method 
##### Secent Method 
We will try to undrstand which method will is better in term of time saving and effient.
## The Bisection Method :
