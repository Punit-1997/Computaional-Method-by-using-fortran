# Computational-Method-by-using-fortran
This repository help you in understanding and handwaving experience in the basics of numerical and simulation method that help you in vide range of field method 
# Prerequisit for learning :
we are expected to have basic background of fortran-90 language or basics of any other language that will help you in understanding fortran language. we try to make it simple and each and every step is selp explenatory. our main focus will be the numerical methods to solve real life problem.
# outline of content will be given as follows 
A.Root finding method 
B.Integration method 
C.Differentiation method 
D.Least Squre Fitting Method
E.Interpolation
F.Introduction to Monte carlo and there application.
